This program has about 50 lines of sh!t. I can't even understand it anymore, so I asked ChatGPT to rewrite it. It is uploaded only because a friend wants to have it quoted in his essay.

Please just stop reading here and leave. There's nothing more.
  
Why tf are you still reading?  
  
Don't you have anything better to do? Play some games, go for a walk outside, or learn something, for example, calculus, from my side. Or read some books about philosophy, and then you can consider the only question worth considering in philosophy.  
  
Seems like you really have nothing to do. Then, try this:  
$$\int \frac{x^4 \cdot e^x}{1 + e^x} \ dx$$
  
Ok, fine, you're still reading, here's more... solve for y(x):
$$\frac{d^3 y}{dx^3} + 3 \frac{d^2 y}{dx^2} + 3 \frac{dy}{dx} + y = e^x \cos(x)$$
